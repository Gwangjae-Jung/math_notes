In the last chapter, we proved that when $D$ is a PID. and $M$ is a finitely generated $D$-module, then there is a decomposition of $M$ into a free $D$-submodule and a torsion $D$-submodule.
Moreover, if $M=T_1\oplus\mc{F}_1=T_2\oplus\mc{F}_2$ are such decompositions ($T_i$ is a torsion $D$-submodule of $M$ and $\mc{F}_i$ is a free $D$-submodule of $M$ for $i=1, 2$), then $T_1=T_2=M_\tor$ and $\mc{F}_1\approx M/M_\tor\approx \mc{F}_2$.
Since the structure of free $D$-modules is now clear, we are now interested in the structure of the torsion part.
Therefore, throughout this section, $D$ is, again, a PID., and we assume that $M$ is a finitely generated \textit{torsion} $D$-module.
