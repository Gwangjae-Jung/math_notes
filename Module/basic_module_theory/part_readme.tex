Throughout \Cref{module theory}, when considering $R$-modules, $R$ is assumed to be a ring with the nonzero identity, and it is assumed that the identity $1_R$ in $R$ acts on $R$-modules trivially, i.e., whenever $M$ is an $R$-module and $\cdot$ denotes the $R$-scalar multiplication on $M$, $1_R\cdot x=x$ for all $x\in M$.
