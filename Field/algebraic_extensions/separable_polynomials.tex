\section{Separable polynomials}

\begin{thm}
    Suppose that $f(t)$ is a nonconstant polynomial over a field $F$.
    Then $f(t)$ is separable if and only if $f(t)$ and $f'(t)$ do not have a common root.
\end{thm}

\begin{thm}
    An irreducible polynomial over a field of characteristic 0 is separable.
