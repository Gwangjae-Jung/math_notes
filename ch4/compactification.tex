\section{Compactification}

In this section, we introduce a general definition of a compactification, unlike when we studied a one-point compactification.
\begin{defi}[Compactification]
    Given a space $X$, a space $Y$ is called a compactification of $X$ if
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item[(a)] $Y$ is a compact Hausdorff space containing $X$ as a subspace, and
        \item[(b)] the closure of $X$ in $Y$ is $Y$.
    \end{enumerate}
    Two compactifications $Y_1$ and $Y_2$ of $X$ is said to be equivalent if there is a homeomorphism from $Y_1$ into $Y_2$ extending the identity map on $X$.
\end{defi}
\begin{rmk}
    If the space $X$ has a compactification $Y$, because $X$ is a subspace of $Y$, $X$ is necessarily completely regular.
\end{rmk}
It is natural to wonder if every completely regular space has a compactification.
Hopefully, every completely regular space has a compactification, as justified by the lemma which will be introduced soon.
The lemma states first that every space which can be embedded into a compact Hausdorff space has a compactification, and second that if such compactification is required to satisfy an ``extension property'' given as in the lemma, then such compactificaiton is unique up to equivalence.

\begin{lem}[Compactification extending an embedding]\label{emb&cptf}
    Let $X$ be a space such that there is an embedding $h$ of $X$ into a compact Hausdorff space $Z$.
    Then, there is a unique (up to equivalence) compactification $Y$ of $X$ with the following property:
    There is an embedding $H: Y\hookrightarrow Z$ which extends $h$\footnote{Here, $Y$ is unique up to equivalence, but $H$ need not be unique.}.
    \begin{equation*}
        \begin{tikzcd}[row sep=large, column sep=huge]
            X \arrow[dr, "h"', hook] \arrow[r, "\textsf{inclusion}", hook] & Y \arrow[d, "H", hook, dashed] \\
            &Z
        \end{tikzcd}
    \end{equation*}
    Such compactification $Y$ is called the compactificaiton of $X$ induced by $h$.
\end{lem}
\begin{proof}
    We first prove the existence of a compactification $Y$ of $X$ induced by $h: X\hookrightarrow Z$, and then we prove its uniqueness.
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item[(a)]
        {
            Let $X_0:=h(X)\approx X$ and $Y_0$ be the closure $\overline{X_0}$ of $X_0$ in $Z$.
            To argue that $Y_0$ is a compactification of $X_0$, we check the axioms of compactificaitions.
            Because $Y_0$ is a closed subset of $Z$, $Y_0$ is a compact Hausdorff space.
            Also, $Y_0$ contains $X_0$ as a subspace; every open subset of $X_0$ is of the form $X_0\cap O=X_0\cap(Y_0\cap O)$, where $O$ is an open subset of $Z$.
            Finally, the closure of $X_0$ in $Y_0$ is clearly $Y_0\cap\overline{X_0}=Y_0$.
            Therefore, $Y_0$ is a compactification of $X_0$.
            
            To find a compactification $Y$ of $X$, we seek to find a space $Y$ such that $(X, Y)$ and $(X_0, Y_0)$ are homeomorphic.
            Let $A$ be any set disjoint from $X$ which is in bijection with $Y_0\setminus X_0$ (say $k: A\rightarrow Y_0\setminus X_0$ is such a bijection), and define $Y=X\sqcup A$.
            Define a bijective map $H: Y\rightarrow Y_0$ by
            \begin{align*}
                H(x)=h(x)\quad\textsf{if } x\in X,\\
                H(a)=k(a)\quad\textsf{if } a\in A.
            \end{align*}
            Topologize $Y$ by declaring that $U\subset Y$ is open in $Y$ if and only if $H(U)$ is open in $Y_0$. (Indeed, the collection induced by such declaration is a topology on $Y$.)
            This topologization makes $H$ a homeomorphism.
            It is easy to justify that $Y$ is a compactification of $X$; it is because $H$ extends $h$ and $h: X\rightarrow X_0$ and $H: Y\rightarrow Y_0$ are homeomorphisms.
            To be brief, it is because the following diagram commutes:
            \begin{equation*}
                \begin{tikzcd}[row sep=large, column sep=huge]
                    X\arrow[r, "h", "\approx"']\arrow[d, "\imath"', hook]
                    &
                    X_0\arrow[d, "\imath_0", hook]\\
                    Y\arrow[r, "\approx", "H"'] & Y_0
                \end{tikzcd},
            \end{equation*}
            where $\imath$ is the inclusion embedding of $X$ into $Y$ and $\imath_0$ is the inclusion embedding of $X_0$ into $Y_0$.
        }
        \item[(b)]
        {
            Suppose $Y_1$ and $Y_2$ are compactifications of $X$ which extends $h$ to embeddings from $Y_1$ and $Y_2$ into $Z$, respectively.
            Denote such embeddings by $H_1: Y_1\hookrightarrow Z$ and $H_2: Y_2\hookrightarrow Z$, respectively.
            By restricting the codomains of $H_1$ and $H_2$, we find that $H_2\circ H_1^{-1}$ denotes a homeomorphism between $Y_1$ and $Y_2$ extending the identity map on $X$.
            Therefore, $Y_1$ and $Y_2$ are equivalent.
        }
    \end{enumerate}
    Therefore, if $X$ is a space with an embedding $h$ into a compact Hausdorff space $Z$, then $X$ has a compactification $Y$ such that there is an embedding of $Y$ into $Z$ extending $h$, and such a compactification exist uniquely up to equivalence.
\end{proof}
\begin{rmk}
    We now jestify that every completely regular space has a compactification.
    If $X$ is a completely regular space, by the embedding theorem, $X$ could be embedded into $[0, 1]^I$ for some $I$, which is a compact Hausdorff space.
    Applying \cref{emb&cptf} to this situation gives a compactification of $X$.
    Therefore, a space $X$ has a compactification if and only if $X$ is completely regular.
\end{rmk}
