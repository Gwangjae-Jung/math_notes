\begin{prob}\label{separability equivalences}
    Show that the suggested alternative definition for regular, completely regular, and normal spaces are equivalent to the original definitions.
\end{prob}
\begin{sol}
    Suppose $X$ is a regular space.
    We first show part (a).
    Given a point $a\in X$ with its neighborhood $U$ in $X$, consider the closed subspace $B:=X\setminus U$ of $X$.
    Using the regularity of $X$, one can find a neighborhood $V$ of $a$ in $X$ and a neighborhood $W$ of $B$ in $X$ which are disjoint.
    Then $\overline{V}\subset X\setminus W\subset X\setminus B=U$, proving the only if part.
    To show the if part, suppose whenever a point $a$ of $X$ with its neighborhood $U$ in $X$ is given, there is a neighborhood of $a$ in $X$ whose closure in $X$ is contained in $U$ exists.
    Given a point $x\in X$ and a closed subspace $B$ of $X$ not containing $x$, consider the neighborhood $U:=X\setminus B$ of $x$ in $X$.
    Let $V$ be a neighborhood of $x$ in $X$ whose closure is contained in $U$.
    Then $V$ and $X\setminus\overline{V}$ are disjoint open subsets of $X$ separating $x$ and $B$, proving the if part.

    Part (b) is almost clear, and part (c) follows if we replace points of $X$ with closed subspaces of $X$.

\begin{prob}\label{inheritance: countabilities}
    Prove \cref{inheritance of countabilities}.

    \begin{enumerate}
        \item[(a)]
        {
            Let $Y$ be a subspace of $X$, and assume first that $X$ is first-countable.
            Given a point $p\in Y$, let $\{B_n\}_{n\in\bb{N}}$ be a countable base at $p$ in $X$.
            Then it is easy to check that the restriction $\{B_n\cap Y\}_{n\in\bb{N}}$ is a countable base at $p$ in $Y$.

            Now assume that $X$ is second-countable, and let $\mc{B}=\{B_n\}_{n\in\bb{N}}$ be a countable basis of $X$.
            One can easily find that the restriction $\{B_n\cap Y\}_{n\in\bb{N}}$ is a basis of the subspace topology on $Y$.
        }
        \item[(b)]
        {
            Let $Y$ be a closed subspace of a Lindel\"of space $X$, and let$\{A_\alpha\}_\alpha$ be a covering of $Y$ by sets open in $Y$.
            Note that each $A_\alpha$ is of the form $O_\alpha\cap Y$, where each $O_\alpha$ is open in $X$.
            Since $X\setminus Y$ is open in $X$, countably many members $A_\alpha$, together with $X\setminus Y$, cover $X$.
            This proves that a closed subspace of a Lindel\"of space is a Lindel\"of space.
        }
        \item[(c)]
        {
            Let $X$ be a separable space and $Y$ be an open subspace of $X$.
            And let $D$ be a countable dense subset of $X$, and use the overline notation to denote the closure in $X$ (for example, $\ol D=X$).
            We wish to show that $D\cap Y$ is a (countable) dense subset of $Y$, i.e., $\ol{D\cap Y}\cap Y=Y$.
            For this, it suffices to show $Y\subset\ol{D\cap Y}$.
            In fact, if $p\in Y$ and whenever $V$ is a neighborhood of $p$ in $X$ contained in $Y$, then $V$ contains a point of $D\cap Y$.
            Hence, every point of $Y$ belongs to $\ol{D\cap Y}$, as desired.

            Assume that $p\in Y$ and $C$ is a closed subset of $Y$ not containing $p$.
            Because $C=Y\cap A$ for some subset $A$ closed in $X$ and $A$ does not contain $p$, by regularity of $X$, there are disjoint neighborhoods $U$ of $p$ and $V$ of $A$ in $X$.
            Then $Y\cap U$ and $Y\cap V$ are disjoint neighborhoods of $p$ and $C$ in $Y$.

            To justify the regularity of $X$, we make use of the alternative definition.
            Let $x$ be a point of $X$ and $U$ be a neighborhood of $x$ in $X$.
            Here, we may assume that $U=\prod_{\alpha\in\mc{A}} B_\alpha$, where $B_\alpha$ is open in $X_\alpha$ for each $\alpha\in\mc{A}$ and $B_\alpha=X_\alpha$ for all but finitely many values of $\alpha\in\mc{A}$.
            For each $\alpha\in\mc{A}$, use the regularity of $X_\alpha$ to find a neighborhood $V_\alpha$ of $x_\alpha$ in $X_\alpha$ whose closure in $X_\alpha$ is contained in $B_\alpha$ (when $B_\alpha=X_\alpha$, choose $V_\alpha=X_\alpha$).
            Then $V=\prod_{\alpha\in\mc{A}} V_\alpha$ is a neighborhood of $x$ in $X$ contained in $U$.
            (Note that the closure of the product is the product of the closures.)

            Let $x$ be any point of $X$ whose $\alpha$-component is $p_\alpha$ and let $K=\pi_\alpha^{-1} (C_\alpha)$.
            Because $K$ is closed in $X$ and does not contain $x$, by the regularity of $X$, there are disjoint neighborhoods $U$ of $x$ and $V$ of $K$ in $X$.
            Applying the result of the following remark (together with the homeomorphism), we can conclude that $X_\alpha$ is regular.

\begin{rmk}
    Let $\{X_\alpha\}_{\alpha\in\mc{A}}$ be a collection of topological spaces, and assume that $X_\alpha$ is a singleton whenever $\alpha\neq\beta$.
    Then $X_\beta$ is homeomorphic to $X=\prod_{\alpha\in\mc{A}} X_\alpha$.
    Indeed, one can impose an explicit homeomorphism.
    Let $s_\alpha$ be the unique element of $S_\alpha$ for each $\alpha\neq\beta$, and let $\imath: X_\beta\rightarrow X$ be the map defined by
    \begin{align*}
        (\pi_\alpha\circ\imath)(x)=\left\{\begin{array}{cc}
            x   &   \textsf{(if $\alpha=\beta$)}\\
            s_\alpha    &   \textsf{(otherwise)}
        \end{array}\right.
        \quad
        \textsf{(for all $x\in X_\beta$)}.
    \end{align*}
    Then $\imath$ is a desired homeomorphism.

            By normality, there are disjoint open subspaces $U$ and $V$ in $X$ containing $A$ and $B$, respectively.
