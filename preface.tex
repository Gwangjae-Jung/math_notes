\chapter*{Preface}

This note is written to help anyone who reviews undergraduate algebra.
Thus, it is highly recommended to study undergraduate algebra at least once before reading this note, for most of details will not be introduced in this note.
Also, some sections are not written yet, because I haven't studied them.
