\section{Monotone class lemma}

\begin{defi}[Monotone class]
    A monotone class on a set $X$ is a collection $M$ of subsets of $X$ which is closed under countable monotone unions and countable monotone intersections.
\end{defi}

\begin{thm}[Monotone class lemma for sets]
    Let $\mc{A}$ be an algebra of sets on $X$.
    Then the monotone class generated by $\mc{A}$ is precisely the $\sigma$-algebra on $X$ generated by $\mc{A}$.
\end{thm}
\begin{proof}
    Let $\mc{C}$ denote the monotone class generated by $\mc{A}$ and $\mc{M}$ denote the $\sigma$-algebra generated by $\mc{A}$.
    It is clear by definition that $\mc{C}\subset\mc{M}$, so it remains to prove $\mc{M}\subset\mc{C}$, and it suffices to prove that $\mc{C}$ is an algebra on $X$; it then implies that $\mc{C}$ is a $\sigma$-algebra on $X$ (containing $\mc{A}$).
    To this end, we will justify the following statement:
    \begin{quotation}
        For each member $E\in\mc{M}$, define
        \begin{align*}
            \mc{M}(E):=\{F\in\mc{M}: E\setminus F,\, F\setminus S,\, E\cap F\in\mc{M} \}.
        \end{align*}
        Then $\mc{M}(E)=\mc{M}$ for all $E\in\mc{M}$.
    \end{quotation}
    (If the above statement is true, then $\mc{M}$ is closed under arbitrary finite intersections, and because $X\in\mc{A}\subset\mc{M}$, $\mc{M}$ is closed under set complements.)

    To prove the above statement, one should notice the followings:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item[(\romannumeral 1)]
        {
            For $E, F\in\mc{M}$, we have $E\in\mc{M}(F)$ if and only if $F\in\mc{M}(E)$.
        }
        \item[(\romannumeral 2)]
        {
            $\mc{M}(E)$ is a monotone class on $X$ whenever $E\in\mc{M}$. \color{brown}(Check.)\color{black}
        }
    \end{enumerate}
    If $A$ is a member of $\mc{A}$, then $B\in\mc{M}(A)$ for all $B\in\mc{A}$, so it follows that $\mc{M}\subset\mc{M}(A)$, i.e., $\mc{M}(A)=\mc{M}$ for all $A\in\mc{A}$.
    Thus, for a given member $E\in\mc{M}$, because $E\in\mc{M}(A)$ for all $A\in\mc{A}$, we have $A\in\mc{M}(E)$ for all $A\in\mc{A}$, implying that $\mc{M}=\mc{M}(E)$, as desired.
\end{proof}
