\section{Compact metrizable spaces}

We first introduce some other types of compactness:
\begin{defi}
    Let $X$ be a space.
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item[(a)] $X$ is said to be limit point compact, if every infinite subset of $X$ has a limit point in $X$.
        \item[(b)] $X$ is said to be sequentially compact, if every infinite sequence with values in $X$ has a convergent subsequence.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{defi}
\begin{rmk}
    If $X$ is sequentially compact, then $X$ is complete, i.e., every Cauchy sequence in $X$ is convergent.
\end{rmk}

\begin{prop}
    Compactness implies limit point compactness.
\end{prop}
\begin{proof}
    Left as an exercise.
\end{proof}

In metrizable spaces, the above three compactness coincide.
\begin{thm}
    Suppose $X$ is a metrizable space.
    Then the followings are equivalent:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item[(a)]
        {
            $X$ is compact.
        }
        \item[(b)]
        {
            $X$ is limit point compact.
        }
        \item[(c)]
        {
            $X$ is sequentially compact.
        }
    \end{enumerate}
\end{thm}
\begin{proof}
    We already proved that (a) implies (b) and it is easy to show that (b) implies (c).
    The most difficult part of the proof is to show that (c) implies (a).
    Assume $X$ is sequentially compact.
    
    \textbf{Step 1: Showing the existence of the Lebesgue number.}\newline\indent
    We wish to prove that for any open cover $\mc{A}$ of $X$ there is a real number $\delta>0$ such that every open set with diameter less than $\delta$ is contained in some member of $\mc{A}$.
    Suppose there is no such $\delta$.
    Then, for each $n\in\bb{N}$, there is an open set $C_n$ of diameter less than $1/n$ which is not contained in any member of an open cover $\mc{A}$ of $X$.
    Choose a point $x_n\in C_n$.
    By sequential compactness, the sequence $(x_n)_n$ has a convergent subsequence $(x_{n_k})_k$.
    Let $x$ be the limit of the subsequence, and let $A$ be a member of $\mc{A}$ containing $x$.
    And let $r>0$ be a real number such that $B_d(x, r)\subset A$.
    If $i$ is large enough so that
    \begin{center}
        $\ds{d(x, x_{n_i})<\frac{r}{2}}$\quad and\quad$\ds{\frac{1}{n_i}<\frac{r}{2}}$,
    \end{center}
    then $C_{n_i}$ lies in $A$, a contradiction.
    
    \textbf{Step 2: Showing that $X$ is totally bounded.}\newline\indent
    Suppose $X$ is a sequentially compact space which is not totally bounded.
    We can choose countably many points $x_1, x_2, \cdots\in X$ such that $\bigcup_{n=1}^\infty B_d(x_n, \epsilon)\subsetneq X$ for some $\epsilon>0$.
    Since $X$ is sequentially compact, we can find a convergent subsequence $(x_{n_k})_k$ of $(x_n)_n$, a contradiction.
    
    \textbf{Step 3: Deriving that $X$ is compact.}\newline\indent
    Let $\mc{A}$ be an open cover of $X$.
    By the result of Step 1, there is a Lebesgue number $\delta>0$ for the collection $\mc{A}$.
    By the result of Step 2, finitely many balls in $X$ of radius $\ds{\frac{2\delta}{5}}$ cover $X$.
    Therefore, a finite subcover of $\mc{A}$ covers $X$. 
\end{proof}

In metric spaces, the above equivalence reduces to the Heine-Borel theorem.
\begin{thm}[Heine-Borel theorem]
    Let $(X, d)$ be a metric space.
    Then the followings are equivalent:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item[(a)]
        {
            $X$ is compact.
        }
        \item[(b)]
        {
            $X$ is limit point compact.
        }
        \item[(c)]
        {
            $X$ is complete and totally bounded.
        }
    \end{enumerate}
\end{thm}
\begin{proof}
    By the preceeding theorem, it suffices to show that (c) is equivalent to compactness.
    Since it is already observed that sequential compactness implies (c), it suffices to show that (c) implies any of compactnesses.
    For this, we will show that (c) implies sequential compactness.

    Let $(x_n)_n\subset X$ be a sequence.
    Since $X$ is sequentially compact, there is a ball $B_1$ in $X$ of radius $2^{-1}$ which contains $x_n$'s for infinitely many $n\in N_1\subset\bb{N}$.
    Because $X\cap B_1$ is also totally bounded, a ball $B_2$ with the center in $X\cap B_1$ of radius $2^{-2}$ contains $x_n$'s for infinitely many $n\in N_2\subset N_1$.
    Continuing inductively, we can find $n_i\in N_i$ for each $i\in\bb{N}$ with $n_1<n_2<\cdots$.
    Then $d(x_{n_i}, x_{n_k})\leq 2^{1-i}$ if $i<k$.
    Because $X$ is complete, $(x_n)_n$ has a convergent subsequence.
    Therefore, (c) implies sequential compactness.
\end{proof}
