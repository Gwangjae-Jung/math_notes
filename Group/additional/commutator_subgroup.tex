\section{Commutator subgroups}

\begin{defi}[Commutator subgroup]
    For a group $G$, write
    \begin{align*}
        [G, G]=\genone{ghg^{-1}h^{-1}: g, h\in G}
    \end{align*}
    and call $[G, G]$ the commutator subgroup of $G$.
    Each element of $G$ of the form $ghg^{-1}h^{-1}\,(g, h\in G)$ is called a commutator, and is also denoted by $[g, h]$.
\end{defi}
\begin{rmk}
    A group $G$ is an abelian group if and only if $[G, G]=\{1_G\}$.
\end{rmk}

\begin{prop}
    Let $G$ be a group.
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item[(a)]
        {
            $[G, G]\nmal G$.
        }
        \item[(b)]
        {
            $G/[G, G]$ is an abelian group.
        }
        \item[(c)]
        {
            Assuming $N\nmal G$, $G/N$ is an abelian group if and only if $[G, G]\leq N$.
            Hence, $G/[G, G]$ is the largest abelian quotient of $G$.
        }
        \item[(d)]
        {
            If $\phi: G\rightarrow A$ is a homomorphism of a group $G$ into an abelian group $A$, then $\phi$ factors through $[G, G]$, i.e., $[G, G]\leq\ker\phi$.
            Hence, $\phi$ induces a homomorphism $\ol\phi: G/[G, G]\rightarrow A$ of abelian groups such that $\ol\phi\circ\pi=\phi$.
            \begin{equation*}
            \begin{tikzcd}[row sep=1.0cm, column sep=1.5cm]
                G\arrow[d, "\pi"', ->>]\arrow[dr, "\phi"]    &   \\
                G/[G, G]\arrow[r, "\ol\phi"', dashed]   &   A
            \end{tikzcd}
            \end{equation*}
        }
    \end{enumerate}
\end{prop}
\begin{proof}
    \color{brown}Checking (a) and (b) is left as an exercise. \color{black}
    To prove (c), note that $G/N$ is an abelian group if and only if $[G/N, G/N]=\{1_{G/N}\}$, which is equivalent to $[G, G]\leq N$.

    To prove (d), note that $[G, G]\leq\phi^{-1}(\{1_A\})$ so $\ol\phi$ is a well-defined group homomorphism; since $G/[G, G]$ is abelian, $\ol\phi$ is a homomorphism of abelian groups.
\end{proof}

\begin{prob}
    Find a group $G$ such that $Z(G/Z(G))$ is nontrivial.
\end{prob}
\begin{sol}
    Let $G=D_8$, where $D_8$ is the dihedral group of order 8.
    Then $Z(G)=\{1, r^2\}$ and $G/Z(G)$ is a group of order 4, which is abelian.
    Hence, the center of $G/Z(G)$ is nontrivial.
