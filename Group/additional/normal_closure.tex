\section{Generated normal subgroups}

Let $G$ be a group and $S$ be a subset of $G$.
We have learned that the subgroup of $G$ generated by $S$ is the intersection of all subgroups of $G$ containing $S$, which is the set of words with alphabets in $S\cup S^{-1}$.
\begin{defi}[Generated normal subgroup]
    Let $G$ be a group and $S$ be a subset of $G$.
    The normal subgroup $(S)$ of $G$ generated by $S$ is defined as the intersection of all normal subgroups of $G$ containing $S$.
\end{defi}
\begin{prop}
    Let $G$ be a group and $S$ be a subset of $G$.
    Then
    \begin{align*}
        (S)=\genone{gsg^{-1}: g\in G, s\in S}.
    \end{align*}
\end{prop}
\begin{proof}
    Let $G_S=\genone{gsg^{-1}: g\in G, s\in S}$.
    We first show that $G_S$ is a normal subgroup of $G$ containing $S$.
    It is clear that $G_S$ contains $S$.
    Given a word $w:=(g_1s_1g_1^{-1})\cdots(g_ns_ng_n^{-1})\in G_S$ with $g_i\in G, s_i\in S\cup S^{-1}$ and $x\in G$, we have
    \begin{align*}
        xwx^{-1}=(xg_1s_1g_1^{-1}x^{-1})\cdots(xg_ns_ng_n^{-1}x^{-1})\in G_S.
    \end{align*}
    Hence, $G_S$ is a normal subgroup of $G$.
    
    The proof is done if it is proved that $(S)$ contains $G_S$, which is clear because $(S)$ is a normal subgroup of $G$ containing $S$.
\end{proof}
